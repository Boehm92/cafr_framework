Before running the program, please execute the following installation guide
1. Create a virtual environment based on python 3.7
2. Select the main.py file as script path
3. type pip install -r requirements.txt into your terminal while your virtual environment is selected
4. Depending on your operation system, if you use pip or Conda, your preferred PyTorch version and if you use 
your CPU or a specific CUDA version you have to change the wheel links in the requirements file.
Therefor, just select your 	preferred configuration at https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html
